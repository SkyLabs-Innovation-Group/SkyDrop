# [SkyDrop](http://app.skydrop.hns.to/)

Our app is inspired by the user experience of Apple’s AirDrop feature for iOS and Mac: we have created a secure, private, FOSS (Free and Open Source) alternative for sharing text and uncompressed files between Android and iOS devices using QR codes.

* iOS - [Get SkyDrop on App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1568591168#?platform=iphone)

* Android - [Get SkyDrop on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=to.hns.skydrop)

SkyDrop is free software; your files are uploaded to your preferred Skynet portal. Files will usually be pinned for 30 days but to guarantee long term storage be sure to ask about plans with your portal provider.

This project is open source under MIT license. We built SkyDrop using .NET’s native cross-platform app framework Xamarin and MvvmCross framework.

We are working on updated FAQs now that the Skynet Labs portals have shut down. The default portal in app now is https://web3portal.com/, please check their privacy policy when using public uploads, and we recommend using the new end-to-end encryption feature to secure your files so they could only be decrypted by their intended recipient.

To turn your links into QR codes, you can use the mobile app or our web app at https://encodeqr.hns.web3portal.com/ to convert text to QR codes (which can also be received by the mobile app).

FAQ:

My images won't load in app! Try selecting your portal under 'Portals' and tapping the API token field to log in again - restart the app after you're done.
