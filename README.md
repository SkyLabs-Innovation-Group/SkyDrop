# SkyDrop

We want to make Skynet's decentralised storage cloud useful to all mobile users, with a new mobile app for decentralised file transfer. With SkyDrop, you will be able to upload one or more files to Skynet, and share your files using QR codes which point to Skylinks.

SkyDrop is intended as a cross platform alternative to AirDrop on iOS. We also support the wider vision of an interoperable, extensible, and decentralised web3, and hope to later offer public nuget packages for our skynet-js ports and extensions, to help attract C#Â .NET developers to the skapp development space through ease of access.
