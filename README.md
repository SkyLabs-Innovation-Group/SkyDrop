# SkyDrop

We want to make Skynet's decentralised storage cloud useful to all mobile users.

SkyDrop version 1.0 is a cross platform AirDrop alternative, which mobile users can use to upload one or more files to Skynet, then locally generate a QR code for the Skylink. This QR code can be scanned by another SkyDrop app, or any other QR scanning app, in order to retrieve the link and receive the file.
