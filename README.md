# [SkyDrop](http://app.skydrop.hns.to/)

We took inspiration from popular file sharing apps like WeTransfer, and Apple’s polished AirDrop app for iOS and Mac, and decided to create SkyDrop: a free and open source alternative for sending multiple files, including large files, from one mobile device to another using a simple link or a QR code.

* iOS - [Get SkyDrop on App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1568591168#?platform=iphone)

* Android - [Get SkyDrop on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=to.hns.skydrop)

  * Alternatively, use the cryptographically secure app store by redsolver, [SkyDroid](https://skydroid.app/), to install SkyDrop instead! If you have trouble finding the app in SkyDroid, click the + and enter **skydrop**.

SkyDrop is free to download and has no ads; your files are uploaded to your preferred Skynet portal and are therefore redundantly backed up on Sia’s decentralised blockchain powered cloud.

This project is open source under MIT license. We built SkyDrop using .NET’s native cross-platform app framework Xamarin and MvvmCross framework.

We are working on updated FAQs now that the Skynet Labs portals have shut down. The default portal in app now is https://web3portal.com/, please check their privacy policy.

To turn a skylink into a QR code on your PC, you can use our adjacent web app at https://encodeqr.hns.web3portal.com/
